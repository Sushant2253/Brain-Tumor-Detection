# Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning üß†üíª

A deep learning-based application to detect brain tumors from MRI scans using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built on the VGG19 architecture. The model predicts whether a tumor is present in the uploaded MRI image and provides the accuracy of each individual prediction.

<h2>üåü Project Overview</h2>
Brain tumor detection is a crucial aspect of medical imaging, aimed at assisting doctors and radiologists in diagnosing conditions accurately. This project leverages deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to analyze MRI images and identify the presence of tumors.

<h3>üß† About Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)</h3>
<p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are deep learning architectures commonly used for image processing tasks. CNNs are particularly effective in image classification due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies in images.</p>

<p>In this project, we use the VGG19 architecture, a pre-trained model known for its depth and performance in image recognition tasks. VGG19 employs 19 layers with learnable weights and is effective in capturing fine-grained details, making it suitable for MRI image analysis.</p>

For a deeper understanding of CNNs, refer to [this guide](https://www.ibm.com/topics/convolutional-neural-networks) on CNNs.<br>
